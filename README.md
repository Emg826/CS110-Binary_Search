# CS110-Binary_Search
A class project for Imperative Problem Solving (CS110).

In this project the goal was to read in an ordered (ascending) set of numbers from a text file and implement a recursive binary search on that set.

This project required:
  + Reading a set of numbers into an array from a text file (test.txt)
  + Determining whether or not that set of numbers is in ascending order
  + Implementing the recursive binary search algorithm
  
...uploaded after completion
